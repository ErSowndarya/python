#Ask the user to enter height in centimeters. Return the same height in feet and inches.
#Floating point values in the answer should be rounded up or down to the nearest integer
#”Optional” addition to your code:
#Add exception handling, in case the user enters an invalid input (use try… except statements, by referring to THIS article)

#Conversion formulae:
#1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
#1 feet = 12 inches
cm=float(input("Enter height in centimeters:"))
print("The entered height is equal to feet",round(feet),round(inches))
